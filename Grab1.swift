/*
Question 1 -
A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
'C' -> 3
...
'Z' -> 26

Given a non-empty string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.
Explanation
Like if we've 123 as input the we can decode it into following way -

123 -> ABC where 1 -> 'A', 2 -> 'B' and 3 -> 'C'
123 -> LC where 12 -> 'L' and 3 -> 'C'
123 -> AW where 1 -> 'A' and 23 -> 'W'
